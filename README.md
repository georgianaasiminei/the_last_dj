# the_last_dj
A book about the struggles of a troubled DJ living as the last of its kind, in a world that's new even to itself. (Compilation of awkwardness and fail)

This is my attempt to homage the creators of epic movies such as "Birdemic", "Plan 9 from outer space", "Troll 2", "Baby Geniuses 2", "Manos, the hands of fate" and last but not least "The worst horror movie ever made".

Let the gods of fail bring me inspiration.
